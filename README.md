# TESS_simulator

This is the simulation software to support the publication https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/link_gateway/2018AJ....156..255B/doi:10.3847/1538-3881/aae697

The basic work flow is that there is an input list of stars generated by a simulation that have simulated planets detected by transit spectropscopy.
That sample of stars is then observed. Each observation consists of one or more exposures and uses the scheduler developed by Burt et al. 2014.
